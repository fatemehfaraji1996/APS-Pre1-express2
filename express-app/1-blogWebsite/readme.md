## Design the index.html page to resemble the preview provided. Additionally, set up an Express application. Create a posts array to store post data.

Implement the following routes:

- 1. GET request for "/": Displays all posts stored in the posts array.

- 2. GET request for "/compose": Renders the compose.html page.

- 3. POST request for "/compose": Receives data from the inputs on the compose.html page, adds it to the posts array, and redirects to the home page to display the updated posts.

# we are going to have a simple loggin page

## Design the index.html page and implement express for app.

Define the following routes:

- 1. a get request for "/" that sends index.html file
- 2. a post request for "/" that receives username and password from the index.html inputs and returns a successful message if the password was equal to "123456789"

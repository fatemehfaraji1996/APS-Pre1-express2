## we are going to have a simple wether app here

# that's easy way to go.we just want some request with special routes as follows:

# 0.Design the index.html page and implement express for app.you can use any wether api.

# 1.a get request for "/" that sends index.html file

# 2.a post request for "/" that receives cityname variable from index.html input and returns the temp,description,icon to the page

## hint: you may use response.write
